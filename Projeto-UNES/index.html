                    <p>
                        It is a long <strong> fact that a reader</strong> will be distracte 
                        by the readable <em>of</em> a page when looking at its layout.
                        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
                        normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content 
                        here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
                        Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use 
                        Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 
                        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
                        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum 
                        passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
